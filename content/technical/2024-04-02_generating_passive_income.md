## The Journey to Passive Income

Five years ago, I set out on a mission: to create a sustainable source of passive income that would allow me to quit my day job and focus purely on passion projects. Today, I can finally say I've achieved that goal.

## Lessons from My Mistakes

Failures are often the best teachers, so let’s start with what I did wrong. If I could go back, here’s what I’d do differently:

1. **Overcomplicating Tech Choices** – I built everything in Kubernetes thinking it would be a fun tech stack to learn. It was fun, but completely unnecessary.
2. **Jumping on New Tech Blindly** – AI ethics can be controversial, and I underestimated how much debate this would generate.
3. **Not Knowing When to Step Back** – At some point, I became a bottleneck in my own process rather than a benefit.
4. **Waiting Too Long to Share My Journey** – I wish I had documented and talked about this earlier.

## The 7 Stages of Building the Business

### **Stage One: Defining the Goals**

My goal was simple—create passive income. But there were a few caveats:

- I didn't want to do it under my real name (hello, imposter syndrome!).
- I had very little creative ability.
- I didn't trust "set and forget" models.
- I wanted to keep learning along the way.

---

### **Stage Two: Finding the Right Niche**

I knew my limitations:

- I couldn't create high-quality art.
- I wasn’t a writer who could publish best-selling books.
- I didn't want to manage a business that required direct human involvement.

So, I needed to build something that could evolve on its own while consistently generating revenue.

---

### **Stage Three: Failing Fast**

I embraced the "fail fast" mentality, testing ideas quickly without getting too attached. My background in game development and AI led me to experiment with self-hosted, internet-based games.

I launched **10 different (bad) games** to see what worked. I kept costs low, polled friends for story ideas, and accepted that the art and music would be… questionable.

**The result?** A spectacular failure.

- Hosting costs exceeded earnings.
- Marketing and advertising were expensive.
- I lost sleep balancing this with my full-time job.

Here’s an example of one of my early attempts:

Yep, this was a _real_ published game. Now you see why I didn’t want my name attached.

After a month of reflection, I realized I was **breaking my own rules**—I was spending _more_ time and _more_ money on something that wasn’t bringing me joy. I had to rethink my approach.

### **Stage Four: Automation with Generative AI**

Instead of struggling with what I wasn’t good at, I automated it using AI.

- I leveraged open-source AI models (ethically trained) to generate art.
- I switched to static hosting, drastically reducing server costs.
- I monetized games through ads to create a sustainable revenue stream.

With these changes, things started looking up:

### **Stage Five: Refining the Process**

I didn’t fully automate everything right away—I first needed to prove it was worth it.

**Key changes:**

- I removed _high-cost, low-reward_ game genres (e.g., JRPGs).
- I automated **idea generation** with generative AI.
- I refined AI prompts from simple _"make me an idle game"_ to advanced techniques like **chain-of-thought prompting**.
- I even automated parts of coding, reducing my daily workload from hours of development to simple **QA testing**.

Eventually, I realized **I was the bottleneck**—so I stepped back and let the AI take over.

### **Stage Six: Profitability & Full Automation**

Now, the system runs on autopilot. For the last **six months**, I haven’t touched it—except to pay the cloud bill. Yet, the income keeps flowing.

Every week, the pipeline automatically:

1. Checks advertising revenue and community feedback.
2. Scans gaming platforms like Reddit, itch.io, and IncrementalDB for trends.
3. Generates and publishes a new game.
4. Deploys to **Android Play Store** or **web platforms**.

Android games are my biggest moneymaker, but I keep both streams active for stability.

---

### **Stage Seven: Keep Learning & Improving**

Now that my proof of concept is working, I won’t stop tinkering. I could **walk away today** and live off this system—but where’s the fun in that?

---

## **(Some) Tools I Used**

Over five years, I’ve used countless tools, but here’s what my final stack looks like:

- **Frontend**: Loveable (recently rebuilt UI)
- **AI Models**: Fine-tuned models from Hugging Face
- **Hosting**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Kubernetes (GKE)
- **Languages**: Golang, JavaScript, Python
- **Publishing**: itch.io & Google Play Store

## Final Thoughts

This journey has been full of mistakes, pivots, and unexpected lessons. But in the end, AI-powered automation gave me the freedom I wanted.

If you're thinking about starting your own passive income project, remember: **Fail fast, automate wisely, and keep learning.**
